# apostrophe-schemas

## Code Status

This module is now in production use, powering the `apostrophe-snippets` module, and therefore `apostrophe-blog`, `apostrophe-events`, etc. Everything you see here has been tested, with the exception of the "adding new field types" section, which has been implemented but not yet tested. If you find issues with that feature (which is not critical for any existing A2 modules) we would welcome bug reports and pull requests.

`apostrophe-schemas` adds support for simple schemas of editable properties to any object. Schema types include text, select, apostrophe areas and singletons, joins (relationships to other objects), and more. This module is used by the `apostrophe-snippets` module to implement its edit views and can also be used elsewhere.

### Accessing the Schemas Object In Your Module

In any project built with the [apostrophe-site](http://github.com/punkave/apostrophe-site) module, every module you configure in `app.js` will receive a `schemas` option, which is a ready-to-rock instance of the `apostrophe-schemas` module. You might want to add it as a property in your constructor:

    self._schemas = options.schemas;

**If you are not using `apostrophe-site`... well, you should be.** But a reasonable alternative is to configure `apostrophe-schemas` yourself in `app.js`:

    var schemas = require('apostrophe-schemas')({ app: app, apos: apos });
    schemas.setPages(pages); // pages module must be injected

And then pass it as the `schemas` option to every module that will use it. But this is silly. Use `apostrophe-site`.

### Adding New Properties To Objects Using the Schema

A schema is a simple array of objects specifying information about each field. The `apostrophe-schemass` module provides methods to build schemas, validate submitted data according to a schema, and carry out joins according to a schema. The module also provides browser-side JavaScript and Nunjucks templates to edit an object based on its schema.

Schema objects have intentionally been kept simple so that they can be send to the browser as JSON and interpreted by browser-side JavaScript as well.

The simplest way to create a schema is to just make an array yourself:

```javascript
var schema = [
    {
      name: 'workPhone',
      type: 'string',
      label: 'Work Phone'
    },
    {
      name: 'workFax',
      type: 'string',
      label: 'Work Fax'
    },
    {
      name: 'department',
      type: 'string',
      label: 'Department'
    },
    {
      name: 'isRetired',
      type: 'boolean',
      label: 'Is Retired'
    },
    {
      name: 'isGraduate',
      type: 'boolean',
      label: 'Is Graduate'
    },
    {
      name: 'classOf',
      type: 'string',
      label: 'Class Of'
    },
    {
      name: 'location',
      type: 'string',
      label: 'Location'
    }
  ]
});
```

However, if you are implementing a subclass and need to make changes to the schema of the superclass it'll be easier for you if the superclass uses the `schemas.compose` method, as described later.

#### What Field Types Are Available?

Currently:

`string`, `boolean`, `integer`, `float`, `select`, `url`, `date`, `time`, `slug`, `tags`, `password`, `area`, `singleton`

Except for `area`, all of these types accept a `def` option which provides a default value if the field's value is not specified.

The `integer` and `float` types also accept `min` and `max` options and automatically clamp values to stay in that range.

The `select` type accepts a `choices` option which should contain an array of objects with `value` and `label` properties.

The `date` type pops up a jQuery UI datepicker when clicked on, and the `time` type tolerates many different ways of entering the time, like "1pm" or "1:00pm" and "13:00".

The `url` field type is tolerant of mistakes like leaving off `http:`.

The `password` field type stores a salted hash of the password via `apos.hashPassword` which can be checked later with the `password-hash` module. If the user enters nothing the existing password is not updated.

When using the `area` and `singleton` types, you may include an `options` property which will be passed to that area or singleton exactly as if you were passing it to `aposArea` or `aposSingleton`.

When using the `singleton` type, you must always specify `widgetType` to indicate what type of widget should appear.

Joins are also supported as described later.

#### Required Fields

You can make any field mandatory by giving it the `required: true` attribute. Currently this is only implemented in browser-side JavaScript, so your server-side code should be prepared not to crash if a property is unexpectedly empty.

If the user attempts to save without completing a required field, the `apos-error` class will be set on the `fieldset` element for that field, and `schemas.convertFields` will pass an error to its callback. If `schemas.convertFields` passes an error, your code should not attempt to save the object or close the dialog in question, but rather let the user continue to edit until the callback is invoked with no error.

If `schemas.convertFields` does pass an error, you may invoke:

`aposSchemas.scrollToError($el)`

To ensure that the first error in the form is visible. Errors are indicated by the presence of the `apos-error` class on the fieldset for a particular element, which you may apply yourself if doing custom validation independent of `convertFields`.

#### Preventing Autocomplete

For most field types, you may specify:

    autocomplete: false

To request that the browser not try to autocomplete the field's value for the user. The only fields that do not support this are those that are not implemented by a traditional HTML form field, and in all probability browsers won't autocomplete these anyway.

### Editing: Schemas in Nunjucks Templates

This is really easy! Just write this in your nunjucks template:

```jinja
{% include 'schemas:schemaMacros.html' %}

<form class="my-form">
  {{ schemaFields(schema) }}
</form>
```

Of course you must pass your schema to Nunjucks when rendering your template.

All of the fields will be presented with their standard markup, ready to be populated by `aposSchemas.populateFields` in browser-side JavaScript.

It is also possible to inject some custom markup around a field. Just output the fields "before" a certain point, then the fields "after" it:

```jinja
{{ schemaFields(fields, { before: 'shoeSize' }) }}
<p>Here comes the shoe size kids!</p>
{{ schemaText('shoeSize', 'Shoe Size') }}
<p>Wasn't that great?</p>
{{ schemaFields(fields, { after: 'shoeSize' }) }}
{% endblock %}
```

In addition to `before` and `from`, you may also use `after` and `to`. `before` and `after` are exclusive, while `from` and `to` are inclusive. Combining `before` and `from` let us wrap something around a specific field without messing up other fields or even having to know what they are.

Yes, you can output your own custom markup for fields, provided the markup has the same data attributes and name attributes.

Note that you do not need to supply any arguments that can be inferred from the schema, such as the `choices` list for a `select` property, or the widget type of a singleton. The real initialization work happens in browser-side JavaScript powered by the schema.

You also need to push your schema from the server so that it is visible to browser-side Javascript:

```javascript
self._apos.pushGlobalData({
  mymodule: {
    schema: self.schema
  }
});
```

### Editing: Browser-Side Javascript

Now you're ready to use the browser-side JavaScript to power up the editor. Note that the `populateFields` method takes a callback:

```javascript
var schema = apos.data.mymodule.schema;
aposSchemas.populateFields($el, schema, object, function() {
  // We're ready
});
```

`$el` should be a jQuery object referring to the element that contains all of the fields you output with `schemaFields`. `object` is an existing object containing existing values for some or all of the properties.

And, when you're ready to save the content:

```javascript
aposSchemas.convertFields($el, schema, object)
```

This is the same in reverse. The properties of the object are set based on the values in the editor. Aggressive sanitization is not performed in the browser because the server must always do it anyway (never trust a browser). You may of course do your own validation after calling `convertFields` and perhaps decide the user is not done editing yet after all.

### Editing: Saving Objects On the Server

Serializing the object and sending it to the server is up to you. (We recommend using `$.jsonCall`.) But once it gets there, you can use the `convertFields` method to clean up the data and make sure it obeys the schema. The incoming fields should be properties of `data`, and will be sanitized and copied to properties of `object`:

```javascript
schemas.convertFields(schema, 'form', data, object)
```

The second argument is set to `'form'` to indicate that this data came from a form and should go through that converter.

Now you can save `object` as you normally would.

### Joins in Schemas

You may use the `join` type to automatically pull in related objects from this or another module. Typical examples include fetching events at a map location, or people in a group. This is very cool.

*"Aren't joins bad? I read that joins were bad in some NoSQL article."*

Short answer: no.

Long answer: sometimes. Mostly in so-called "webscale" projects, which have nothing to do with 99% of websites. If you are building the next Facebook you probably know that, and you'll denormalize your data instead and deal with all the fascinating bugs that come with maintaining two copies of everything.

Of course you have to be smart about how you use joins, and we've included options that help with that.

##### One-To-One Joins

You might write this:

```javascript
  addFields: [
    {
      name: '_location',
      type: 'joinByOne',
      withType: 'mapLocation',
      idField: 'locationId',
      label: 'Location'
    }
  ]
}
```

(How does this work? `apostrophe-schemas` will consult the `apostrophe-pages` module to find the manager object responsible for `mapLocation` objects, which will turn out to be the `apostrophe-map` module.)

Now the user can pick a map location. And if you call `schema.join(req, schema, myObjectOrArrayOfObjects, callback)`, `apostrophe-schemas` will carry out the join, fetch the related object and populate the `_location` property of your object. Note that it is much more efficient to pass an array of objects if you need related objects for more than one.

Here's an example of using the resulting ._location property in a Nunjucks template:

```twig
{% if item._location %}
  <a href="{{ item._location.url | e }}">Location: {{ item._location.title | e }}</a>
{% endif %}
```

The id of the map location actually "lives" in the `location_id` property of each object, but you won't have to deal with that directly.

*Always give your joins a name starting with an underscore.* This warns Apostrophe not to store this information in the database permanently where it will just take up space, then get re-joined every time anyway.

Currently after the user has selected one item they see a message reading "Limit Reached!" We realize this may not be the best way of indicating that a selection has already been made. So you may pass a `limitText` option with an alternative message to be displayed at this point.

##### Reverse Joins

You can also join back in the other direction:

```javascript
  addFields: [
    {
      name: '_events',
      type: 'joinByOneReverse',
      withType: 'event',
      idField: 'locationId',
      label: 'Events'
    }
  ]
```

Now, in the `show` template for the map module, we can write:

```twig
{% for event in item._events %}
  <h4><a href="{{ event.url | e }}">{{ event.title | e }}</a></h4>
{% endfor %}
```

"Holy crap!" Yeah, it's pretty cool.

Note that the user always edits the relationship on the "owning" side, not the "reverse" side. The event has a `location_id` property pointing to the map, so users pick a map location when editing an event, not the other way around.

##### Nested Joins: You Gotta Be Explicit

*"Won't this cause an infinite loop?"* When an event fetches a location and the location then fetches the event, you might expect an infinite loop to occur. However Apostrophe does not carry out any further joins on the fetched objects unless explicitly asked to.

*"What if my events are joined with promoters and I need to see their names on the location page?"* If you really want to join two levels deep, you can "opt in" to those joins:

```javascript
  addFields: [
    {
      name: '_events',
      ...
      withJoins: [ '_promoters' ]
    }
  ]
```

This assumes that `_promoters` is a join you have already defined for events.

*"What if my joins are nested deeper than that and I need to reach down several levels?"*

You can use "dot notation," just like in MongoDB:

```javascript
withJoins: [ '_promoters._assistants' ]
```

This will allow events to be joined with their promoters, and promoters to be joiend with their assistants, and there the chain will stop.

You can specify more than one join to allow, and they may share a prefix:

```javascript
withJoins: [ '_promoters._assistants', '_promoters._bouncers' ]
```

Remember, each of these joins must be present in the configuration for the appropriate module.

#### Many-To-Many Joins

Events can only be in one location, but stories can be in more than one book, and books also contain more than one story. How do we handle that?

Consider this configuration for a `books` module:

```javascript
  addFields: [
    {
      name: '_stories',
      type: 'joinByArray',
      withType: 'story',
      idsField: 'storyIds',
      sortable: true,
      label: 'Stories'
    }
  ]
```

Now we can access all the stories from the show template for books (or the index template, or pretty much anywhere):

```twig
<h3>Stories</h3>
{% for story in item._stories %}
  <h4><a href="{{ story.url | e }}">{{ story.title | e }}</a></h4>
{% endfor %}
```

*Since we specified `sortable:true`*, the user can also drag the list of stories into a preferred order. The stories will always appear in that order in the `._stories` property when examinining a book object.

*"Many-to-many... sounds like a LOT of objects. Won't it be slow and use a lot of memory?"*

It's not as bad as you think. Apostrophe typically fetches only one page's worth of items at a time in the index view, with pagination links to view more. Add the objects those are joined to and it's still not bad, given the performance of v8.

But sometimes there really are too many related objects and performance suffers. So you may want to restrict the join to occur only if you have retrieved only *one* book, as on a "show" page for that book. Use the `ifOnlyOne` option:

```javascript
'stories': {
  addFields: [
    {
      name: '_books',
      withType: 'book',
      ifOnlyOne: true,
      label: 'Books'
    }
  ]
}
```

Now any call to `schema.join` with only one object, or an array of only one object, will carry out the join with stories. Any call with more than one object won't.

Hint: in index views of many objects, consider using AJAX to load related objects when the user indicates interest rather than displaying related objects all the time.

#### Reverse Many-To-Many Joins

We can also access the books from the story if we set the join up in the stories module as well:

```javascript
  addFields: [
    {
      name: '_books',
      type: 'joinByArrayReverse',
      withType: 'book',
      idsField: 'storyIds',
      label: 'Books'
    }
  ]
}
```

Now we can access the `._books` property for any story. But users still must select stories when editing books, not the other way around.

#### When Relationships Get Complicated

What if each story comes with an author's note that is specific to each book? That's not a property of the book, or the story. It's a property of *the relationship between the book and the story*.

If the author's note for every each appearance of each story has to be super-fancy, with rich text and images, then you should make a new module that subclasses snippets in its own right and just join both books and stories to that new module.

But if the relationship just has a few simple attributes, there is an easier way:

```javascript
  addFields: [
    {
      name: '_stories',
      label: 'Stories',
      type: 'joinByArray',
      withType: 'story',
      idsField: 'storyIds',
      relationshipField: 'storyRelationships',
      relationship: [
        {
          name: 'authorsNote',
          type: 'string'
        }
      ],
      sortable: true
    }
  ]
```

Currently "relationship" properties can only be of type `string` (for text), `select` or `boolean` (for checkboxes). Otherwise they behave like regular schema properties.

*Warning: the relationship field names `label` and `value` must not be used.* These names are reserved for internal implementation details.

Form elements to edit relationship fields appear next to each entry in the list when adding stories to a book. So immediately after adding a story, you can edit its author's note.

Once we introduce the `relationship` option, our templates have to change a little bit. The `show` page for a book now looks like:

```twig
{% for story in item._stories %}
  <h4>Story: {{ story.item.title | e }}</h4>
  <h5>Author's Note: {{ story.relationship.authorsNote | e }}</h5>
{% endfor %}
```

Two important changes here: *the actual story is `story.item`*, not just `story`, and *relationship fields can be accessed via `story.relationship`*. This change kicks in when you use the `relationship` option.

Doing it this way saves a lot of memory because we can still share book objects between stories and vice versa.

#### Accessing Relationship Properties in a Reverse Join

You can do this in a reverse join too:

```javascript
  addFields: [
    {
      name: '_books',
      type: 'joinByArrayReverse',
      withType: 'book',
      idsField: 'storyIds',
      relationshipField: 'storyRelationships',
      relationship: [
        {
          name: 'authorsNote',
          type: 'string'
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
```

Now you can write:

```twig
{% for book in item._books %}
  <h4>Book: {{ book.item.title | e }}</h4>
  <h5>Author's Note: {{ book.relationship.authorsNote | e }}</h5>
{% endfor %}
```

As always, the relationship fields are edited only on the "owning" side (that is, when editing a book).

*"What is the `relationshipField` option for? I don't see `story_relationships` in the templates anywhere."*

Apostrophe stores the actual data for the relationship fields in `story_relationships`. But since it's not intuitive to write this in a template:

```twig
{# THIS IS THE HARD WAY #}
{% for story in book._stories %}
  {{ story.item.title | e }}
  {{ book.story_relationships[story._id].authorsNote | e }}
{% endif %}
```

Apostrophe instead lets us write this:

```twig
{# THIS IS THE EASY WAY #}
{% for story in book._stories %}
  {{ story.item.title | e }}
  {{ story.relationship.authorsNote | e }}
{% endif %}
```

*Much better.*

#### Specifying Joins When Calling schemas.join

Sometimes you won't want to honor all of the joins that exist in your schema. Other times you may wish to fetch more than your schema's `withJoin` options specify as a default behavior.

You can force `schemas.join` to honor specific joins by supplying a `withJoins` parameter:

```javascript
schemas.join(req, schema, objects, [ '_locations._events._promoters' ], callback);
```

The syntax is exactly the same as for the `withJoins` option to individual joins in the schema, discussed earlier.

### Adding New Field Types

You can add a new field type easily.

On the server side, we'll need to write three methods:

* A "template" method that just renders a suitable Nunjucks template to insert this type of field in a form. Browser-side JavaScript will populate it with content later. Use the assets mixin in your module to make this code easy to write.
* A converter for use when a form submission arrives.
* A converter for use during CSV import of an object.

The converter's job is to ensure the content is really a list of strings and then populate the object with it. We pull the list from `data` (what the user submitted) and use it to populate `object`. We also have access to the field name (`name`) and, if we need it, the entire field object (`field`), which allows us to implement custom options.

Here's an example of a custom field type: a simple list of strings.

```javascript

// Earlier in our module's constructor...
self._apos.mixinModuleAssets(self, 'mymodulename', __dirname, options);
// Now self.renderer is available

schemas.addFieldType({
  name: 'list',
  template: self.renderer('schemaList'),
  converters: {
    form: function(data, name, object, field) {
      // Don't trust anything we get from the browser! Let's sanitize!

      var maybe = _.isArray(data[name]) ? data[name] || [];

      // Now build up a list of clean content
      var yes = [];

      _.each(maybe, function(item) {
        if (field.max && (yes.length >= field.max)) {
          // Limit the length of the list via a "max" property of the field
          return;
        }
        // Only accept strings
        if (typeof(item) === 'string') {
          yes.push(item);
        }
      });
      object[name] = yes;
    },

    // CSV is a lot simpler because the input is always just
    // a string. Split on "|" to allow more than one string in the list
    csv: function(data, name, object, field) {
      object[name] = data[name].split('|');
    }
  }
});
```

We can also supply an optional `indexer` method to allow site-wide searches to locate this object based on the value of the field:

```javascript
  indexer: function(value, field, texts) {
    var silent = (field.silent === undefined) ? true : field.silent;
    texts.push({ weight: field.weight || 15, text: value.join(' '), silent: silent });
  }
```

The `views/schemaList.html` template should look like this. Note that the "name" and "label" options are passed to the template. In fact, all properties of the field that are part of the schema are available to the template. Setting `data-name` correctly is crucial. Adding a CSS class based on the field name is a nice touch but not required.

```jinja
<fieldset class="apos-fieldset my-fieldset-list apos-fieldset-{{ name | css}}" data-name="{{ name }}">
  <label>{{ label | e }}</label>
  {# Text entry for autocompleting the next item #}
  <input name="{{ name | e }}" data-autocomplete placeholder="Type Here" class="autocomplete" />
  {# This markup is designed for jQuery Selective to show existing list items #}
  <ul data-list class="my-list">
    <li data-item>
      <span class="label-and-remove">
        <a href="#" class="apos-tag-remove icon-remove" data-remove></a>
        <span data-label>Example label</span>
      </span>
    </li>
  </ul>
</fieldset>
```

Next, on the browser side, we need to supply three methods: a displayer and a converter.

"displayer" is a method that populates the form field. `aposSchemas.populateFields` will invoke it.

"converter" is a method that retrieves data from the form field and places it in an object. `aposSchemas.convertFields` will invoke it.

Here's the browser-side code to add our "list" type:

```javascript
aposSchemas.addFieldType({
  name: 'list',
  displayer: function(data, name, $field, $el, field, callback) {
    // $field is the element with right "name" attribute, which is great
    // for classic HTML form elements. But for this type we want the
    // div with the right "data-name" attribute. So find it in $el
    $field = $el.find('[data-name="' + name + '"]');
    // Use jQuery selective to power the list
    $field.selective({
      // pass the existing values in as label/value pairs to satisfy
      // jQuery selective
      data: [
        _.map(data[name], function() {
          return {
            label: data[name],
            value: data[name]
          };
        });
      ],
      // Allow the user to add new strings
      add: true
    });
    // Be sure to invoke the callback
    return callback();
  },
  converter: function(data, name, $field, $el, field) {
    $field = $el.find('[data-name="' + name + '"]');
    data[name] = $field.selective('get');
  }
});
```

This code can live in `site.js`, or in a `js` file that you push as an asset from your project or an npm module. Make sure your module loads *after* `apostrophe-schema`.

### Creating Schemas With Compose and Refine

For many applications just creating your own array of fields is fine. But if you are creating a subclass of another module that also uses schemas, and you want to adjust the schema, you'll be a lot happier if the superclass uses the `schemas.compose()` method to build up the schema via the `addFields`, `removeFields`, `orderFields` and occasionally `alterFields` options.

Here's a simple example:

```javascript
schemas.compose({
  addFields: [
    {
      name: 'title',
      type: 'string',
      label: 'Name'
    },
    {
      name: 'age',
      type: 'integer',
      label: 'Age'
    }
  },
  removeFields: [ 'age' ]
  ]
});
```

This `compose` call adds two fields, then removes one of them. This makes it easy for subclasses to contribute to the object which a parent class will ultimately pass to `compose`. It often looks like this:

```javascript
var schemas = require('apostrophe-schemas');

// Superclass has title and age fields, also merges in any fields appended
// to addFields by a subclass

function MySuperclass(options) {
  var self = this;
  options.addFields = [
    {
      name: 'title',
      type: 'string',
      label: 'Name'
    },
    {
      name: 'age',
      type: 'integer',
      label: 'Age'
    }
  ].concat(options.addFields || []);
  self._schema = schemas.compose(options);
}

// Subclass removes the age field, adds the shoe size field

function MySubclass(options) {
  var self = this;
  MySuperclass.call(self, {
    addFields: [
      {
        name: 'shoeSize',
        title: 'Shoe Size',
        type: 'string'
      }
    ],
    removeFields: [ 'age' ]
  });
}
```

#### Removing Fields

You can also specify a `removeFields` option which will remove some of the fields you passed to `addFields`.

This is useful if various subclasses are contributing to your schema.

```javascript
removeFields: [ 'thumbnail', 'body' ]
}
```

#### Changing the Order of Fields

When adding fields, you can specify where you want them to appear relative to existing fields via the `before`, `after`, `start` and `end` options. This works great with the subclassing technique shown above:

```javascript
addFields: [
  {
    name: 'favoriteCookie',
    type: 'string',
    label: 'Favorite Cookie',
    after: 'title'
  }
]
```

Any additional fields after `favoriteCookie` will be inserted with it, following the title field.

Use the `before` option instead of `after` to cause a field to appear before another field.

Use `start: true` to cause a field to appear at the top.

Use `start: end` to cause a field to appear at the end.

If this is not enough, you can explicitly change the order of the fields with `orderFields`:

```javascript
orderFields: [ 'year', 'specialness' ]
```

Any fields you do not specify will appear in the original order, after the last field you do specify (use `removeFields` if you want a field to go away).

#### Requiring Many Fields

Although `required: true` works well, if you are subclassing and you wish to require a number of previously optional fields, the `requiredFields` option is more convenient. This is especially handy when working with `apostrophe-moderator`:

```javascript
requireFields: [ 'title', 'startDate', 'body' ]
```

#### Altering Fields: The Easy Way

You can specify the same field twice in your `addFields` array. The last occurrence wins.

#### Altering Fields: The Hard Way

There is also an `alterFields` option available. This must be a function which receives the schema (an array of fields) as its argument and modifies it. Most of the time you will not need this option; see `removeFields`, `addFields`, `orderFields` and `requireFields`. It is mostly useful if you want to make one small change to a field that is already rather complicated. Note you must modify the existing array of fields "in place."

#### Refining Existing Schemas With `refine`

Sometimes you'll want a modified version of an existing schema. `schemas.refine` is the simplest way to do this:

var newSchema = schemas.refine(schema, {
  addFields: ...,
  removeFields ..., etc
});

The options are exactly the same as the options to `compose`. The returned array is a copy. No modifications are made to the original schema array.
